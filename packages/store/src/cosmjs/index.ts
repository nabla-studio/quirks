 * Why is this part outside the store?
 *
 * It is useful for it to be external since it depends on the store,
 * but it doesn't have to be reactive, it also allows us to pass these functions outside of a react component,
 * for example if I want to create a promise that signs a message and then I want to give this promise to a library like tanstack-query
